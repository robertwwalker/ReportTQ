<h1>The Entire Process</h1>
<p>I want to generate parameterized R Markdown documents and then link them via a table. This will go in two parts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I will show two ways to make use of parameterized markdown and R. I will deploy RMarkdown and then quarto markdown. Each has advantages and deficiencies, as you will see.</li>
<li>I want to build a table of the documents. ## RMarkdown</li>
</ol>
<p>RMarkdown with parameters is a bit easier because of the way that it handles output directories and the like. For example, in the first iteration of this project, I could use something like the following to render all of the documents to some specified target directory. <em>NB: Because this is all built for github pages, the root of the served directory defaults to /docs.</em></p>
<pre><code>library(tidyquant)
library(rmarkdown)
library(purrr)
Equity.Analyser &lt;- function(x) {
  render("TQ-Parameters.qmd", 
         params = list(ticker = x), 
         output_file = paste0("docs/files/",x,".html"))
}
SP500 &lt;- tq_index("SP500")
SP500$symbol %&gt;% map(., function(x) { Equity.Analyser(x)})</code></pre>
<section id="quarto" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quarto">Quarto</h2>
<p>This took two steps. The first one is to locate where I want the files to appear. In this case, I want them to show up in the <code>docs/files</code> directory. On the Mac, I can deliberately select the working directory like so.</p>
<pre><code>setwd("/Vols/Work/ReportTQ/docs/files")</code></pre>
<p>The issue is that the input file is in the root and <code>quarto_render</code> doesn’t really like this. Instead, I copy the bibliography file and the template [<code>TQ-Parameters.qmd</code>] to this same directory and then invoke from there. With a working directory set, I can then invoke the <code>map</code> with <code>quarto_render</code> and get the files rendered.</p>
<pre><code>library(tidyquant)
library(quarto)
library(purrr)
Equity.Analyser &lt;- function(x) {
  quarto_render("TQ-Parameters.qmd", 
                execute_params = list(ticker = x), 
                output_file = paste0(x,".html"))
}
SP400 &lt;- tq_index("SP400")
SP400$symbol %&gt;% map(., function(x) { Equity.Analyser(x)})</code></pre>
<p>Once I have executed the above, the .html files will be addressable from an expected location with an expected name. Let me now turn to building that table.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-big-table" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-big-table">A Big Table</h2>
<p>I want to use datatable for this. Most of the data comes packaged appropriately from <code>tq_index</code>; I need to match up the naming conventions for the .html files to the directory and naming conventions of the .html.</p>
